              The first thing that comes to mind is diaper rash. Most babies suffer from diaper rash at some point in
              their young lives.
              Coconut oil provides fast relief from the annoying and irritating rash! It nourishes and treats the
              irritated skin and acts as a barrier to
              prevent further irritation from developing.
              <br><br>
              <p>How to Use Coconut Oil for Diaper Rash</p>
              <ul>
                <li>* Apply a generous layer of Virgin coconut oil on your baby’s diaper area after diaper changes</li>
                <li>* Make sure to massage in the groin area and especially in the folds of the skin where the rash
                  first appears.</li>
                <li>* The coconut oil will treat and prevent diaper rash with its moisturizing, antibacterial and anti
                  fungal properties.

              Cradle cap is a common newborn condition that affects many babies during the early weeks after birth.
              The condition is characterized by a dry, flaky scalp that resembles dandruff. Coconut oil really helps!

              <ul>

                </li>
                <li>* Allow oil to remain on the scalp for at least 20 minutes. Using a baby comb or baby hair brush,
                  gently comb or brush to
                  remove the flakes.</li>
                <li> * Once you have brushed off the flakes, you can rinse your baby’s hair with lukewarm water.</li>
                <li>* Repeat as often as needed.</li>

              Eczema is a common infant condition where the skin becomes very dry and itchy. The condition is thought to
              have various causes, and
              often goes away by itself as the baby grows.
              In the meantime, it can be uncomfortable and may even lead to infection due to baby’s scratching the dry,
              irritated skin.
              Coconut-oil is a wonderful hydrating agent, providing relief and protection from infection.

                  moisturize and hydrate the skin.</li>

              </b><br>
              Most baby wash brands contain harmful chemicals that are not healthy for your baby’s skin. Not only that,
              but many babies have skin
              reactions to the various baby products.
              A good general rule of thumb for any skin care product: NEVER APPLY TO YOUR SKIN WHAT YOU WOULDN’T EAT!
              Why? Everything gets absorbed! Unfortunately, most people just don’t realize this.
              Instead of using a store-bought baby wash to clean your little one, make your own coconut oil baby wash at
              home!
              It safely cleans and moisturizes at the same time!

                <li>* Gently massage to remove out any dirt and wash off with the regular bath water.</li>

              If your baby or young child happens to catch lice, coconut oil can be an effective remedy!

                <li>* Once the vinegar becomes dry in your baby’s hair, apply Virgin coconut oil making sure to fully
                  cover all the hair.</li>
                <li>* If possible, cover your baby’s head with a shower cap or baby hat. Allow the coconut oil stay in

              </b><br>
              Research suggests that virgin coconut oil has many benefits for breastfeeding mothers and babies as well!
              When a breastfeeding mother consumes coconut oil, she experiences an immunity boost that she is able to
              pass along to her
              breastfeeding baby!
              Additionally, when coconut oil is applied regularly to sore or cracked nipples, it helps prevent infection
              while relieving pain and itching
              of irritated nipples. Because it is safe (and good!) for babies, no need to wipe it off before feedings!

              <br><br>
              <p>Recent Breastfeeding Research
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>According to a study by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, coconut oil supports mom and
                  baby immunity!
                  Women who consumed coconut oil experienced increased levels of antimicrobial fats. These fats (also
                  called medium-chain fatty acids
                  or MCFA) guard against infection from harmful viruses, bacteria, yeast and parasites.
                  Lauric acid is one of the medium-chain fatty acids found in Virgin coconut oil. When a lactating woman
                  adds lauric acid-rich coconut oil
                  to her diet, the amount of lauric acid available in her breast milk increases substantially. These
                  rich fats not only increase immunity in
                  mother and baby, but are essential to healthy brain development in newborns. This is why these healthy
                  fats are now added to baby
                  formulas!
                  According to Dr. Mary G. Enig, PhD, an expert in lipid chemistry and a fellow of the American College
                  of Nutrition, consuming coconut
                  oil provides important benefits to breast milk.
                  “The milk has increased amounts of the protective antimicrobial lauric acid and capric acid, which
                  gives even greater protection to the
                  infant. If the mother consumes coconut oil every day while nursing, the medium-chain fatty acid
                  content will be even greater.”
                  In countries where coconut oil is a diet staple, levels of lauric acid in the mother’s milk can be as
                  high as 21% and capric acid can be as
                  high as 6% giving her infant even more protection against viruses, bacteria, and protozoa.
                  Mothers who regularly consume coconut oil also report an increase in milk supply. This is believed to
                  be caused by the increased
                  healthy fats in the diet as well as all around improved health of the mother.</li>

              </b><br>
              Coconut oil can also be applied to a baby’s soft spot (or fontanelle) after a bath or massage. Gently
              applying coconut oil helps in
              strengthening these bones as they grow and fuse. Be extra gentle while applying!

              </b><br>
              The Lauric acid in coconut oil eases digestion and may provide relief from your baby’s constipation.
              Try mixing half a teaspoon of virgin coconut oil into your baby’s food.
              Rub the oil around your baby’s perineum (the area around the anus) and leave it overnight.

              </b><br>
              The medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) in coconut oil improve the absorption of nutrients already existing in
              the mother’s diet!
              Moms who consume coconut oil absorb more minerals, magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, fat soluble vitamins
              like A, D, E, K, beta
              carotene, and amino acids. These nutrients are then passed on to the nursing infant through the breast
              milk!
              The MCFAs in coconut oil also help to regulate blood sugar levels in the mother while providing her with a
              stable source of energy.
              Since MCFAs are not stored and instead are burned off in the form of energy, this will help a new mother
              to continue losing any
              unneeded extra baby weight! (Yes!)
              A spoonful of Virgin coconut oil is also a great energy boost for a tired, sleep-deprived mama!
              There are so many other great evidence – based benefits of coconut oil such as weight loss and skin care
              that you should know about
              for your optimal health and beauty!
              <br><br>
              <p>Easy Ways to Get More Coconut Oil into Mom’s Diet!
                Use it for frying or sautéing your food
                Warm it to a liquid state and substitute for liquid oil in recipes
                Make popcorn with coconut oil!
                Eat it by the spoonful!
                Stir or blend into coffee drinks
                Melt it over vegetables
                Mix it into hot cereal
                Massage it into your skin. The health benefits absorb through your skin as well!</p>
